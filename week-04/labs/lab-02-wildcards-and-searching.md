# Week 4 Lab — The Archive Investigation (CLI Simulator)

**Student Name:** Angela Ousley

**Date Completed:** August 6, 2026

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 4  
**Submission Path:** `week-04/labs/lab-02-wildcards-and-searching.md`

## Overview

Lesson 2 gave you the Archive's two tools: patterns that match many filenames at once, and the magnet — `grep` — that searches *inside* files. This lab hands you an Archive of your own and a request slip with three jobs on it: match a set of files with patterns (Part A), hunt down a suspicious log entry with grep (Part B), and run the full find → check → lock down audit that combines this week's two lessons into one workflow (Part C). This lab is more independent than Lab 01 — like Week 3's Scavenger Hunt, the steps tell you *what* to accomplish, and the *how* is on you. One screenshot from this lab becomes part of ★ Deliverable 1.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations CLI Simulator (browser-based, inside the Lab Portal) |
| Shell | Your choice — bash or PowerShell. The steps below show bash syntax; the Lesson 2 Resource Pack's Quick Reference has the PowerShell equivalents |
| Prerequisite | Week 4, Lessons 1 and 2 completed; Lab 01 recommended first |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 4 → CLI Simulator**, and load the **"Foundry District Archive Investigation"** scenario. It seeds a folder of several dozen files — logs, invoices, notes — far too many to open one at a time. Good.

---

## Part A — Work the Request Slip

### Step 1 — Survey the Archive

Before filtering anything, look at what you're working with: run a plain listing of the Archive folder. You don't need to record every filename — just note roughly how many files there are and what naming families you can see (invoices, logs, notes…).

What you observed (rough count + the naming families you spotted):

```
11 files consisting of logs, invoices, notes, and supply lists.
```

### Step 2 — Match One Family With a Pattern

The slip's first request: **every invoice file.** Write a pattern that matches all of them and *only* them, and test it with `ls` — remember the habit: pattern first, look at what it catches, then act.

Command you ran (your ls + pattern):

```
ls inv-*
```

Output (the matched files):

```
inv-april.txt
inv-february.txt
inv-january.txt
inv-march-supplement.txt
inv-march.txt
```

### Step 3 — Get Precise

The slip gets pickier: **only the invoices from a single month** (the scenario panel tells you which). Refine your pattern so it catches exactly those — you may need a second `*`, a `?`, or a `[ ]` set, depending on how the names are built.

Command you ran:

```
ls inv-march*
```

Output (the matched files — and nothing extra):

```
inv-march-supplement.txt
inv-march.txt
```

### Step 4 — Act on a Pattern

Create a folder named `evidence` and copy your Step 3 matches into it with a single `cp` command using your pattern. Confirm the copies landed with `ls evidence`.

Commands you ran (mkdir, cp with pattern, confirming ls):

```
mkdir evidence
cp inv-march* evidence/
ls evidence
```

---

## Part B — Run the Magnet

### Step 1 — Search One File

The slip's second request: the scenario's access log records badge events, and somewhere in it are **denied entries**. Search the log the scenario panel names for the word `denied` — and remember the Strict Teacher: decide whether you need the case-insensitive flag.

Command you ran:

```
grep -i denied door-access.log
```

Output (every matching line):

```
08:12 DENIED badge 2214 east door - retry OK
12:40 DENIED visitor badge front desk
02:47 DENIED badge 4471 storeroom door
```

### Step 2 — Find the Line That Matters

Most denied entries are routine — mistyped badges at reasonable hours. One is not. Identify the suspicious line (think: what *time* would worry you?) and record it exactly.

The suspicious line, and why you flagged it:

```
02:47 DENIED badge 4471 storeroom door. I flagged it because the denial of entry happened at 2:47 am for the storeroom.
```

### Step 3 — Widen the Sweep

One log is never the whole story. Re-run your search across **every** log file in one command — a pattern where the filename goes. Note which files your suspicious word appears in.

Command you ran:

```
grep -i denied *.log
```

Which files contained matches:

```
door-access.log and west-access.log
```

---

## Part C — Find, Check, Lock Down

The slip's last request is the real test: **somewhere in this Archive is a file listing storeroom badge codes.** You don't know its name. You know what's inside it.

### Step 1 — Find It by Its Contents

Search every text file for the term the scenario panel gives you, in one command. Record which file comes back.

Command you ran:

```
grep -i badge-code *.txt
grep -i code *.txt

I ran the first command in order to complete the challenge b/c that's what the simulator was looking for.
I ran the second command to actually view the badge codes b/c the first command didn't show the codes.
```

The file you found:

```
meeting-recap.txt
```

### Step 2 — Check Who Can Touch It

Before you walk away — this is the Week 4 reflex now — run the long listing on that file and read its rings. Record what you find. Is this file as locked down as its contents deserve?

Command you ran and its output:

```
Command: ls -l meeting-recap.txt 
Output: -rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   129 meeting-recap.txt
```

Your read of the situation:

```
The meeting-recap.txt file isn't locked down as its contents deserve. The current permissions allow for the owner, group, and others to read and write. Other users definitely shouldn't have permission to read and write a file that holds the storeroom badge codes.
```

### Step 3 — Lock It Down

Fix the file's permissions so only its owner can read and write it — Gatekeeper's Rule applies: check, change, check again.

Commands you ran (including both ls -l checks):

```
chmod o-rw meeting-recap.txt
ls -l meeting-recap.txt
chmod g-rw meeting-recap.txt
ls -l meeting-recap.txt
```

The file's permission string BEFORE and AFTER:

```
Before: -rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   129 meeting-recap.txt
After: -rw------- 1 morgan foundry   129 meeting-recap.txt
```

### Step 4 — Capture Your Investigation Evidence (REQUIRED screenshot)

Take one screenshot of your simulator session showing your Part C sequence — the search that found the file, the permission check, and the fix. **This screenshot is required — it is part of ★ Deliverable 1.** Name it `cli-search-investigation.png`. Upload and embed it via the GitHub Commit section below.

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** In Part A you tested every pattern with `ls` before letting `cp` act on it. Explain what could go wrong if you skipped straight to acting — and why the stakes get higher when the command attached to the pattern is `rm`. *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
If you [cp] before using [ls] you don't know or are assuming that you know what files are listed in your current directory. Without checking first, you may copy a file that doesn't exist so you actually didn't copy anything at all. An even bigger issue would be copying or removing files that you didn't intend to copy or remove. The stakes are higher when the [rm] command is used because you can't undo a removal of a file. Always [ls] before and after any changes are made.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** Your Part B search returned several routine matches and one suspicious one. In a real security job, why is "reducing six hundred lines to three worth reading" often more valuable than any single answer the search returns? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
Reducing six hundred lines to three worth reading is more valuable than the search returning a single answer because you can see more than one entry at time which allows you to have a quicker analysis. Viewing a few denied entries and the details of the entries (time, location, etc.) will help you determine which one is suspicious more quickly than viewing each entry one at a time and having to find the next result until you find the record you're searching for.
```

**Analysis Question 3.** Part C found a sensitive file by its *contents*, then audited its *permissions*. Explain why neither skill alone would have been enough — what does each half of the workflow catch that the other misses? *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
Searching for the sensitive file by its contents was the quickest way to find the file since it was named incorrectly. Without knowing the name of the file, we wouldn't know which file to look at to see its permissions. And while we could've viewed the permissions for all the files, we still wouldn't have known to edit the permissions to the 'meeting-recap.txt' file because we wouldn't know that it had badge codes without using [grep] with the right keyword(s) or reading the data in file.
```

**Analysis Question 4.** The Archive had dozens of files; real systems have millions. Which habit from this lab do you think scales up the furthest into professional work, and why? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
This lab teaching me how to search for keywords in many different files at once scales up the furthest into professional work. Knowing what to search for is something I can learn on the job, like how the names of the invoice files are formatted or which type of file extensions hold the data I'm looking for. Lessons from the lab on how to search for a specific invoice by using the right commands, flags, and arguments is what will take me far in my career. So knowing exactly how to search using the command line to narrow down results quickly and efficiently is the best habit I'm taking from this lab.
