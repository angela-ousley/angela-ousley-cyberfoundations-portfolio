# Week 3 Lab 03 — Command Line Scavenger Hunt (CLI Simulator)

**Student Name:** Angela Ousley

**Date Completed:** July 29, 2026

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 3  
**Submission Path:** `week-03/labs/lab-03-command-line-scavenger-hunt.md`

---

## Overview

Labs 01 and 02 walked you through each command step by step. This lab is Week 3's wrap-up challenge: a deeper, more independent folder structure with three hidden files to track down, using the navigating and reading commands from Lessons 3A/3B, the creating and organizing commands from Lesson 3C, and your own judgment about when to ask for help. There's less hand-holding here on purpose — this is your chance to prove to yourself that the blinking cursor from the start of Lesson 3A doesn't intimidate you anymore.

**Nothing here can break anything real.** Same consequence-free CLI Simulator as Labs 01 and 02. Getting "lost" in the folder tree costs you nothing but a few extra `cd` moves.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations CLI Simulator (browser-based, inside the Lab Portal) |
| Shell | Your choice — bash or PowerShell |
| Prerequisite | Labs 01 and 02 completed |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 3 → CLI Simulator**, and load the **"Foundry District Archive Room"** scenario. This tree goes several folders deeper than Labs 01 and 02, and includes a few similarly-named folders on purpose — read carefully before you `cd` into anything.

---

## Part A — The Hunt

Find all three of the following, hidden at different depths in the Archive Room tree:

- A file related to a **shift log**
- A file related to a **maintenance note**
- A file related to a **supply inventory**

For each one, use `pwd`/`Get-Location` and `ls`/`dir` as many times as you need while you search, then record the **full path** once you find it.

Shift log file — full path once found:

```
/home/archivist/operations/ops-log/shift-log.txt
```

Maintenance note file — full path once found:

```
/home/archivist/records/records-2025/maintenance-note.txt
```

Supply inventory file — full path once found:

```
/home/archivist/records/records-2024/supply-inventory.txt
```

---

## Part B — Read and Report

For each of the three files you found in Part A, use `cat`/`type` to read it and record what it says.

Shift log contents:

```
Shift Log - Foundry District Archive Room
07:00 - Archive opened, no incidents overnight.
15:00 - Routine filing complete.
```

Maintenance note contents:

```
Maintenance Note - Conveyor belt 2 serviced, next check due in 90 days.
```

Supply inventory contents:

```
Supply Inventory - Q4 2024
Gloves - 400 units
Masks - 250 units
Tape - 60 rolls
```

---

## Part C — Organize Your Findings

Now that you've located and read all three files, clean up after yourself the way a professional would — don't leave your findings scattered across the tree.

### Step 1 — Create a Sorted-Findings Folder

Create a new folder called `sorted-findings` in your home directory.

Command you ran:

```
mkdir sorted-findings
```

### Step 2 — Move All Three Files Into It

Move the shift log, maintenance note, and supply inventory files — the same three you found in Part A — into `sorted-findings`.

Commands you ran:

```
mv operations/ops-log/shift-log.txt sorted-findings/shift-log.txt
mv records/records-2025/maintenance-note.txt sorted-findings/maintenance-note.txt
mv records/records-2024/supply-inventory.txt sorted-findings/supply-inventory.txt
```

### Step 3 — Confirm the Move

List the contents of `sorted-findings` to confirm all three files are now there.

Command you ran:

```
cd sorted-findings
ls
```

Output:

```
maintenance-note.txt shift-log.txt supply-inventory.txt
```

## Part D — When You Get Stuck

At some point in the Archive Room, you'll likely run across a command or folder name you don't immediately recognize.

### Step 1 — Ask the Terminal

When that happens, use `--help`, `man`, or `Get-Help` instead of guessing. Record what you looked up and what you learned.

Command or term you looked up:

```
chmod --help
```

What the help text (or the folder's contents) told you:

```
It changes who can read, write, or execute a file
```

### Step 2 — Describe a Wrong Turn

Everyone takes at least one wrong turn in a tree this size. Describe one moment you ended up somewhere unexpected, and how you used `pwd`/`Get-Location` and `cd ..` to recover.

```
I ended up in 'records-2024', but I meant to go into 'records-2025'. I [pwd] after I went into 'records-2024' and that's when I realized my mistake. I used [cd ..] to go back into 'records' and then [cd records-2025] to get into 'records-2025'.
```

## Analysis Questions

### Analysis Question 1

Which of the three files in Part A took the longest to find, and what was it about the tree's structure (depth, similarly-named folders, etc.) that made it harder?

```
All three files in Part A took about the same amount of time for me to find. The tree wasn't too much in depth and I wrote down what I found at each [cd] level. Each subfolder only had one file, so that made it easier to sort out as well. I did have to pay close attention to 'records-2024' and 'records-2025' because the titles are only one number off and I did mix them up once.
```

### Analysis Question 2

Compare how you felt starting this lab to how you felt at the very start of Lesson 3A, looking at a blank blinking cursor for the first time. What changed?

```
At the start of Lesson 3A, I felt rusty with using the command line because I've only used it in CTFs and I only used it once this year. At the start of this lab, I felt pretty confident thanks to the lessons. I felt better about using it knowing that I wouldn't break anything in a true live environment. The Bash commands are easier for me to remember than the PowerShell commands, but it was nice to learn I can use a lot of the Linux commands in Windows as well.
```

### Analysis Question 3

Week 4 moves from managing your own files to controlling who's allowed to do what to them — permissions — plus your first look at what a virtual machine is. Based on everything you've practiced this week, what's one thing you're curious about or looking forward to?

```
Based on what I've practiced this week, I'm looking forward to learning more Linux commands and getting more fluid when writing out commands, paths, and arguments. I definitely plan on using the Linux resources Marissa shared in the Resource Library. I'm looking forward to learning about how to change the permissions next week. I'm assuming that's using [chmod] and setting read, write, and/or execute permissions for different groups. That will be new territory for me, so I'm excited.
```

## GitHub Commit Subsection

Same mechanism as Labs 01 and 02: fill out this lab's worksheet in the **CyberFoundations Lab Portal** (Week 3 → Lab 03) and click **Submit to GitHub** — the Portal commits the completed file to `week-03/labs/lab-03-command-line-scavenger-hunt.md` automatically. No manual typing or commit needed.

**📌 Optional:** a CLI Simulator session screenshot can be added the same way as Labs 01 and 02 — upload to `assets/screenshots/week-03/`, then right-click the uploaded image and choose **Copy image address**/**Copy Image Link** to embed it — but it isn't required and won't affect your grade.
