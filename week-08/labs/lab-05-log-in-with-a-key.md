# Week 8 Lab 05 — Log In with a Key

**Student Name:** Angela Ousley

**Date Completed:** September 12, 2026

**Module:** 3 — Practical Cryptography  
**Submission Path:** `week-08/labs/lab-05-log-in-with-a-key.md`

> ## STOP — Protect secrets
> Never paste, upload, commit, or screenshot a password, passphrase, or private key. Do not run `cat` on any private-key file. Submit only the worksheet and the named screenshots. Keep all cryptographic files on the VM.

## How to Use This Lab

- **[TERMINAL]** means type or paste the command into the Cloud Heights terminal.
- **[WORKSHEET]** means type your response in this lab worksheet.
- Run commands in the order shown. Do not type the sample output.
- If your result does not match the stated success check, stop at the Troubleshooting box. Do not improvise with `sudo`, package installation, Azure settings, or SSH server configuration.

## Mission

Authorize the public key created in Lab 03 and prove that `analyst@localhost` authenticates with that key without falling back to the account password.

## What You Already Know

In Week 6, SSH used the `analyst` account password. Here, the server stores the public key in `authorized_keys`, while the private key stays in the client account. The same user, protocol, and destination remain; only the authentication method changes.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

**Required prerequisite:** Complete Lab 03 first.

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
whoami
cf-week8-check
test -f ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519 &&   test -f ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub &&   echo "READY: Lab 03 key pair exists" ||   echo "STOP: complete Lab 03 before continuing"
```

**Continue only if:** `whoami` prints `analyst`, all checks report `PASS`, and the final line begins with `READY`.

### If the VM Stops

Return to **My Lab Environment** in the Lab Portal and start your assigned VM. A stopped or deallocated VM is not deleted; saved disk files remain.

## Predict First

**[WORKSHEET]** Does the private key need to be copied into `authorized_keys`? Explain.

```text
No, the private key does not need to be copied into the 'authorized_keys' file. Private keys are only kept on the client's device. Only the public key is shared to the 'authorized_keys' file on the server.
```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 — Prepare `authorized_keys`

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Step 2 — Add the Week 8 Public Key Once

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
grep -qxF "$(cat ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub)" ~/.ssh/authorized_keys   || cat ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

This command adds the key only if an identical line is not already present.

### Step 3 — Confirm the Entry and Safe Permissions

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
grep -c 'week8-analyst-key$' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
stat -c '%a %n' ~/.ssh ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**Required result:** The count is `1`; permissions show `700` for `.ssh` and `600` for `authorized_keys`.

**Evidence moment:** Capture this result as `week08-lab05-authorized-key-permissions.png`.

### Step 4 — Run the Public-Key-Only Proof

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
ssh   -o PreferredAuthentications=publickey   -o PasswordAuthentication=no   -i ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519   analyst@localhost   'echo "AUTH_TEST=PUBLICKEY_SUCCESS"; whoami; hostname'
```

If SSH asks whether to trust the host fingerprint, type `yes` and press Enter. If no fingerprint question appears, continue; `localhost` was already known. Do not delete `known_hosts` to force the question.

At `Enter passphrase for key`, enter the **Lab 03 key passphrase**. Do not enter the `analyst` account password.

**Required result:**

```text
AUTH_TEST=PUBLICKEY_SUCCESS
analyst
cf-student-XX
```

The final hostname will contain your assigned VM number instead of `XX`.

**Evidence moment:** Capture the three result lines as `week08-lab05-publickey-auth-success.png`.

## Stop & Check

If the command asks for the `analyst` account password, reports `Permission denied`, or does not print `AUTH_TEST=PUBLICKEY_SUCCESS`, do not submit. The options in the proof command disable account-password fallback for this one test only; they do not change the VM server.

### Troubleshooting

1. Run `grep -c 'week8-analyst-key$' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`; required value is `1`.
2. Run `stat -c '%a %n' ~/.ssh ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`; required values are `700` and `600`.
3. Run `ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub`; it must show the Lab 03 key.
4. If any check fails, stop and contact the instructor. Do not edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, use `sudo`, disable password authentication, or delete `known_hosts`.

## Explain

**[WORKSHEET]** In 4–5 sentences, compare Week 6 password authentication with this key-based test. State what changed and what stayed the same.

```text
The way the analyst is authenticated changed from password based (week 6) to key-based. Another thing that changed is the server holds the public key while the client keeps the private key. What stayed the same is the analyst being on the VM at the localhost and the same encrypted connection via SSH. The server is also still holding on to what it needs to verify the user (public key vs. password).
```

## Analysis Questions

1. What changed between the Week 6 and Week 8 SSH logins?

```text
What changed between the week 6 and week 8 SSH logins is how the analyst is authenticated, password vs. a key. The second change is the server holding the public key.
```

2. What stayed the same?

```text
The analyst being on the VM at the localhost, the same encrypted SSH connection, and the server holding on to what it needs to verify the user all remained the same.
```

3. Why does `authorized_keys` contain the public key rather than the private key?

```text
The 'authorized_keys' contains the public key rather than the private key because the public key gets shared to the server. The private key never gets shared, it remains with the client.
```

4. Why is the forced proof stronger evidence than a normal successful SSH login?

```text
Connecting with the [-o PasswordAuthentication=no] flag to forces the SSH client to only use key-based authentication. A successful login under this restriction is evidence the key method worked. Without using this method, you can't be sure that authentication didn't use a password as a backup method to login.
```

5. How is the key passphrase different from the `analyst` account password?

```text
The key passphrase is different from the 'analyst' account password because the passphrase protects the private key. The 'analyst' password is used to authenticate the user.
```
