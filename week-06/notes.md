# Week 6 Notes — Cloud Heights: Cloud VMs, SSH, VNets & Layers

**Student Name:** Angela Ousley

**Date Completed:** Aug 25, 2026

Summarize this week's key concepts in your own words — not copy-pasted definitions. This week moved from the simulated Grid into a real cloud environment, so focus on what you personally observed as well as what each term means.

> **Cloud Heights Security Rule:** Your Bastion shareable link and Cloud Heights password are private access credentials. Never paste either into this file, a screenshot, your GitHub repository, Circle, or a chat message.

## Key Concepts This Week

- **Cloud** — other people's computers, professionally operated and reached over a network
- **Datacenter** — the physical facility where cloud computing equipment lives
- **Region** — a geographic area where a cloud provider operates datacenters
- **Virtual machine (VM)** — a computer created in software; in Cloud Heights, your VM runs on hardware in a real datacenter
- **IaaS / PaaS / SaaS** — different levels of cloud service: rent the room, rent the workshop, or rent the finished service
- **Shared responsibility model** — the cloud provider secures the building and underlying platform; the customer is still responsible for what belongs to them
- **Provisioning** — creating and preparing a resource so it is ready to use
- **Golden image / snapshot** — a known starting point that can be used to create consistent machines
- **Snapshot vs backup** — a snapshot is a point-in-time copy used for recovery or cloning; a backup is a separate recovery copy with a different purpose
- **Azure Bastion** — the guarded front desk that gives you browser-based SSH access without giving your VM a public IP
- **Bastion shareable link** — sensitive access information that must never be committed to GitHub or exposed in screenshots
- **SSH (Secure Shell)** — remote command-line access to another machine
- **SSH client and server** — the client starts the connection; the server listens and answers
- **Port 22** — the standard numbered door used by SSH
- **Host / fingerprint verification** — the verify-before-approve habit when connecting to a host for the first time
- **Authentication** — proving that you are the account you claim to be
- **Remote session / remote shell** — the live command-line session running on another machine
- **Getting TO vs getting INTO a machine** — network reachability and authentication are different problems
- **`hostname`** — asks which machine you are on
- **`whoami`** — asks which account you are using
- **`pwd`** — asks where you are in the filesystem
- **Private IP address** — an address used inside a private network rather than directly on the public internet
- **Virtual network (VNet)** — the private cloud neighborhood where resources communicate
- **Subnet** — a smaller address range inside a VNet; a floor inside the larger building
- **NAT / outbound translation** — lets a privately addressed machine communicate outward without giving the machine its own public IP
- **Network Security Group (NSG)** — the network guard post that controls what traffic is allowed; you take control of these rules in Week 7
- **Known-good reference point** — a target whose expected behavior gives you something reliable to compare against
- **Grid Beacon** — the known-good Cloud Heights host at `10.60.6.4`
- **The silent Azure gateway** — Azure's default gateway may not answer ICMP ping even when the network is healthy
- **OSI model** — the seven-layer vocabulary used to organize network and application behavior
- **TCP/IP model** — the more compact layer model commonly used by practitioners
- **Layers** — a way to separate different jobs in a communication path so troubleshooting can be systematic
- **Encapsulation** — information travelling inside other information, like a letter inside an envelope inside a mailbag
- **The Ladder Rule in the real cloud** — work outward, prove what works, use the route and a known-good target, and never let one silent tool response choose the culprit by itself

## My Cloud Heights Command Table

You used these commands on a real Ubuntu machine this week. Instead of memorizing syntax, write down the **question each command answers** or the job it performs.

| Command | What question does it answer / what does it do? |
| --- | --- |
| `hostname` | Tells which machine I'm on |
| `whoami` | Tells which account I'm using |
| `pwd` | Where I'm at in the directory |
| `ip addr` | What's my IP address  |
| `ip route` | What's my default gateway  |
| `ping` | Tests if target is reachable  |
| `traceroute` | Shows the hops/path to the target |
| `dig` | Look up the target's name |
| `curl` | Shows if server is responding |
| `ssh` | Secure shell on a remote machine |
| `exit` | Log out of the remote session  |

## In My Own Words

### 1. Getting TO vs Getting INTO

Explain the difference between getting **TO** a machine and getting **INTO** a machine. Use something you personally observed in Cloud Heights as evidence.

```
Getting to a machine confirms reachability, getting into a machine confirms authentication. In Cloud Heights, I was able to reach SSH port 22 and login with a password through authentication. I was also denied when I entered in the incorrect password, so I reached the port but could not enter.
```

### 2. The Silent Gateway

Your Azure gateway did not answer `ping`, but your VM was still healthy. Explain how you proved the network was working and what this taught you about interpreting tool output.

```
I proved the network was working by pinging a known reachable target, the grid beacon. This showed that my local network was functioning properly. It taught me that a failed ping is only part of the puzzle and doesn't mean that the target is down. I also learned that not getting a response when pinging the VM gateway is normal because it's set not to respond to pings.
```

### 3. Private on the Inside, Connected to the Outside

Explain how your Cloud Heights VM can reach the internet even though it has only a private IP address. Then explain how **you** reach the VM from outside its VNet.

```
My Cloud Heights VM can reach the internet through Network Address Translation. NAT translates the private IP into a public IP address and sends the data along the internet. 

I can reach the VM from outside the VNet through Azure Bastion. Since the VM doesn't have a public IP address, Bastion routes the incoming traffic.
```

### 4. VNet vs Subnet

Explain the difference between a VNet and a subnet using the Cloud Heights building/floor analogy. Then explain why separating systems into smaller network ranges can help security.

```
A VNet is the building, the virtual network as a whole. A subnet is a floor in the building. Separating the network into smaller network ranges (subnets) can help security by creating a barrier between each floor. If a security breach happens on one floor, defenders can deny access to that traffic so it doesn't reach the other floors.
```

### 5. The Ladder Rule Has a Map Now

The Ladder Rule never used the words OSI or TCP/IP. Explain how the layer models give you a map for the same troubleshooting process you have already been using.

```
Layers 1-2 of the OSI model is related to the first step of the ladder rule, which is "check yourself". Checking my own network connection is key and deals with the physical and data link layers. The next step on the ladder is checking my gateway. The gateway is related to layer 3 of the model because it deals with routing. The next step in the ladder is checking the target address, or pinging the address to see if there's a response. This relates to the application layer.
```
